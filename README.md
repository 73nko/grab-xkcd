A blog post titled, ["Diving into Go by Building a CLI Application"](https://eryb.space/2020/05/27/diving-into-go-by-building-a-cli-application.html) has been making it's rounds of the internet. 
It uses a small XKCD downloader as the subject. I thought was small and self contained enough, 
that it'd be interesting to see the same example in Rust! [....]

I'm gonna follow [this tutorial post](https://kbknapp.dev/rust-cli/) to do it ðŸ¥³
